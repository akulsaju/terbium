# Terbium - The DIY printer

DIY!!! I'm gonna make it as easy as possible

Made by: @akul  
Repository link: https://github.com/akulsaju/terbium  
Hours so far: 99h 23m  

- [x] I have a Prusa and access to larger printers  
Printer that's gonna be small, fast, cheap!

## The plan  
I don't know, but I'll figure it out in the vacations. I never failed anything when money isn't a constraint :D  

1. Cheap (hope so)  
2. Capable of printing a Benchy  
3. 210x210x210mm  
4. Cute & colorful  
5. DIY-Friendly  

I'm buying everything from China (AliExpress, etc.).  
Currently, the outline is 210mm x 210mm

| 10/02 | Init                     | 20 min    | Setting up Journal.md. Just getting started, felt like a productive move. |
| 11/02 | Checking random YT videos | 1 hour    | Videos being too complicated lol. People either over-explain or barely explain. |
| 11/02 | Defining dreams          | 10 min    | What are my needs? Realized I just want a printer that's cheap and works. |
| 14/02 | Searching parts on AliExpress | 3 hours   | Who knows if every part works!! So many options, too many choices. |
| 16/02 | Searching then designing in Onshape  | 9.5 hours | There goes my day (Makes sense why I need Spotify Premium). |
| 17/02 | More parts and modeling              | 8 hours | Got Spotify Premium. Design starting to look like an actual printer. |
| 18/02 | Found out I messed up my dimensions (mm and cm) | 6 hours | Fixing in Onshape. My brain swapped mm for cm, massive mistake. |
| 21/02 | Lol fixing                               | 2 hours  | :D Just fixing what I messed up earlier, happens a lot. |
| 21/02 | Making bed                   | 3.5 hours  | Should I put a design on the bed? Custom engraving might be cool. |
| 21/02 | Finish Y axis                        | 6 hours | Yay, one axis down. Feels like progress! |
| 21/02 | Start of Z axis                      | 4 hours | Looks nice :P Adding constraints and making sure it moves properly. |
| 22/02 | Finished Z axis!!!                   | 3 hours | Only printhead and electronics to go. Getting closer. |
| 23/02 | Working on head                      | 3 hours | Trying to make it modular for easy upgrades. |
| 24/02 | Tiny bit of research                 | 23 min   | Continuing... Needed a break but still made progress. |
| 26/02 | Trying to get CFD work               | 20 min | Works! Thermal and airflow analysis looks decent. |
| 27/02 | Refining frame design                | 5 hours  | Adjusting dimensions, verifying part alignment. Making it more rigid. |
| 28/02 | Finalizing motion system             | 6 hours  | Optimizing belt paths, ensuring smooth motion. No skipped steps allowed! |
| 29/02 | Fixing minor issues in Y axis        | 4 hours  | Adjusting tolerances, better mounting for stability. Belt tension was off. |
| 02/03 | Updating Z axis model                | 5 hours  | Strengthening structure, reducing weight. Swapping out a few parts. |
| 03/03 | Designing printhead mount            | 4 hours  | Ensuring compatibility with hotend and extruder. Swapping between different mounting styles. |
| 05/03 | Improving electronics mounting       | 5 hours  | Adding cable management solutions. Wires everywhere are NOT fun. |
| 07/03 | Testing different bed support options| 4 hours  | Preventing warping, improving heat distribution. Making sure the bed stays level. |
| 09/03 | Revising extruder mounting           | 4 hours  | Checking for better filament path. Want minimal resistance for smoother prints. |
| 10/03 | Investigating different hotend options | 3 hours | Ensuring best heat dissipation and flow. Hotend affects everything! |
| 11/03 | Enhancing cooling solutions          | 3 hours | Adding better fans for part cooling. Essential for bridging. |
| 12/03 | Working on aesthetic elements        | 3 hours | Making it look good! No boring black printers. |
| 13/03 | Structural analysis for frame        | 4 hours | Ensuring rigidity and minimizing vibrations. Vibration = ugly prints. |
| 14/03 | Bed leveling mechanism improvements  | 3 hours | Making leveling more precise and easy. Manual vs auto leveling? |
| 15/03 | Finalizing assembly constraints      | 5 hours  | Making it truly DIY-friendly. Every part should be easy to put together. |
| 16/03 | Reviewing entire model for conflicts | 4 hours  | Ensuring every part fits correctly. Adjusting minor interferences. |
| 17/03 | Simulation of movement parts         | 5 hours  | Checking stress points and possible failures. Making sure things donâ€™t snap. |
| 18/03 | Running final interference checks    | 5 hours  | Making sure nothing collides, testing tolerances in software. No unexpected crashes! |
| 19/03 | Fixing Colliding parts  | 6 hours  |Fixing it |
| 20/03 | another part is too thin | 6 hours  | Fixed!! |
