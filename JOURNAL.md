*"Designing a printer because I hate free time."*

### **February 10, 2024**  
Opened Onshape. Stared at blank screen. Drew a cube. Deleted cube. Felt like a fraud. Created GitHub repo. Wrote *"DIY printer project!!!"* in README. Closed laptop. Ate cereal.  

---  

### **February 11, 2024**  
Watched a 10-year-old YouTube video about RepRap printers. Guy used **fishing line** for belts. Panicked. Decided aluminum extrusions are safer. Googled *"how to CAD."* Got lost in a forum thread titled *"Why does my cube have 7 sides?"* Gave up.  

---  

### **February 14, 2024**  
Spent 3 hours on AliExpress. Added 4 motors, 10m of *"GT2"* belt (reviews said *"snaps like twig"*), and 100 M3 screws to cart. Closed tab. *"Iâ€™ll order laterâ€¦ maybe."* Lied to myself.  

---  

### **February 16, 2024**  
CAD all-nighter. Drew a bracket. Realized itâ€™s 2D. *"3D printers need 3D parts, right?"* Googled *"how to extrude."* Made a 3D bracket. Rotated it 180 times. Still upside-down. Cried.  

---  

### **February 18, 2024**  
**DISASTER.** Designed Y-axis in **CENTIMETERS**. Bed size: 2100mm. *"Printer for giants?"* Redrew everything. Cried in metric. GitHub commit: *"Fixed units (I think)."*  

---  

### **February 21, 2024**  
Tried modeling Y-axis belts. Pulleys collided with *nothing*. Onshape yelled *"CONSTRAINT CONFLICT."* Deleted half the parts. *"Good enough."*  

---  

### **February 22, 2024**  
Z-axis time! Tried lead screws. Forgot nuts. *"Theyâ€™ll self-alignâ€¦ right?"* Simulated motion. Screws bent like spaghetti. Switched to belts. Belts sagged. Switched back.  

---  

### **February 23, 2024**  
Printhead design hell. Wanted modular hotend. Drew mount. Forgot thermal expansion. *"PLA will holdâ€¦ probably."* Added unicorn horn for cooling. Removed horn. *Sad.*  

---  

### **February 24, 2024**  
Reddit *"research."* Found post: *"My printer exploded."* Comments: *"Skill issue."* Closed tab. *"Terbium wonâ€™t explodeâ€¦ maybe."*  

---  

### **February 26, 2024**  
Ran *"CFD"* on fan ducts. Airflow yeeted prints into orbit. Added 5 more fans. *"Cooling solved."* (It wasnâ€™t.)  

---  

### **February 27, 2024**  
Frame wobbled in simulation. Added 47 brackets. Now looks like a bridge designed by a drunk pigeon. *"Sturdy. Ugly. Progress."*  

---  

### **February 28, 2024**  
Belt path trauma. Pulleys phased through frame. *"Physics is optional."* Deleted pulleys. Belts now float in mid-air. *"Modern art."*  

---  

### **February 29, 2024**  
Y-axis revenge. Onshape error: *"OVERDEFINED SKETCH."* Deleted constraints. *"Who needs math?"*  

---  

### **March 2, 2024**  
Extruder design. Filament path? *"Itâ€™ll find a way."* Gears clipped through frame. *"Abstract sculpture."*  

---  

### **March 5, 2024**  
Electronics fantasy. Placed motherboard *inside* frame. *"Heat? Just add more fans."* Wires? *"Invisible layer. Problem solved."*  

---  

### **March 7, 2024**  
Bed leveling in CAD. Added screws that turn themselves. *"Skynet vibes."* Forgot springs. *"Screws will stretchâ€¦ right?"*  

---  

### **March 12, 2024**  
Aesthetic crisis. Rendered frame neon green. *"Retinas burned."* Switched to purple. Added RGB LEDs. *"Rave printer."*  

---  

### **March 15, 2024**  
GitHub repo glow-up. Added GIF of CAD model spinning. README: *"Itâ€™s not a bug, itâ€™s a feature."* Got 1 star (my cat).  

---  

### **March 18, 2024**  
X-axis ate the frame. *Again.* Added limit switches. *"Hungry printer. Feed it STLs."*  

---  

### **March 20, 2024**  
Exported STLs. Theyâ€™ll 100% need rework. *"Future meâ€™s problem."*  

---  

### **Vibe Check**  
- **CAD Hours:** *"99h 23m"* (Lie. Itâ€™s 300h.)  
- **Confidence:** *"Itâ€™ll workâ€¦ maybe."*  
- **Aesthetic:** *Lisa Frankâ€™s nightmare.*  
- **Next Step:** *Order partsâ€¦ or burn it all.*
